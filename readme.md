Radiosounding monitoring
========================

This repository includes the R code for processing the log files output in the automatic radiosounding process carried out at the Meteorological Service of Catalonia.

The repository contains two different versions; the first is the version operative since 2014 that includes log file processing and interactive result visualization and the second is a 2019 version that improves the previous in robustness and flexibility but has only implemented the log file processing.
