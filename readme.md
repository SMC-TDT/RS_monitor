Radiosounding monitoring
========================

This repository includes the R code for processing the log files output in the automatic radiosounding process carried out at the SMC. The */log_data/* folder contains sample log files. 

The repository contains two different versions:

- **2014_version**: operative since 2014, includes log file processing and interactive result visualization.
- **2019_version**: developed in 2019, improves the previous version in robustness and flexibility but only implements the log file processing.
